## Usage
### Setting up environment
It is recommended that you use a virtual environment when using Poker440. First, create the environment in the terminal.

>```pwsh
>python -m venv ds440
>```

Then, activate this venv so that you can install any requirements. Using Powershell:

>```pwsh
>ds440\Scripts\activate
>```

Alternatively for MacOS & Linux, if you are using zsh or bash:

>```bash
>source ds440/bin/activate
>```

Finally, within the activated shell in the project directory, run

>```pwsh
>pip install -r requirements.txt
>```

## Background
As our group was looking to find a topic for our semester project, we thought to look at imperfect games, such as no limit Texas holdâ€™em poker. The longstanding models for the game are a resource to many players, ranging from casual learners to professionals in tournaments. With the ongoing developments in RL learning, we believe that we can use new implementations to improve a model to which hundreds of thousands of paying players use. Our main goal with our project is to give access to players a better strategy for profiting in their games, all while analyzing different, situational playstyles.
