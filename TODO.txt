TODO
----------------------------------------
1. Outsource the data generation in Environment.py into another class, maybe called DataGen or something. The idea is that if we can bulk-generate data in batches, we can create a seed that is associated with a certain sequence of randomly generated hands. This will allow us to test the different algorithms against one-another with the exact same data to see how they react in the exact same circumstances.

2. Implement A3C, DQN and MonteCarlo models. Import Environment.py and the (TODO)DataGen.py into the file. This way, we can keep the implementations separate from one another and try different things out.
